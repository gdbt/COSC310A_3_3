# COSC310A_3_3
Noah Arndt Assignment 3 COSC310
This code used the core idea and responses from Assignment 2. With some very drastic changes.
First off I had to fix many errors in the original code upon Assignment 2 submissions
I took the code and transfered it over to android studio, after many hours of recoding it to work I was able to create a chat bot with a pretty UI
within android studio and turned it into a phone app that I could bring anywhere

Some of the features I implemented were

-The travel topic, an extra topic with some responses
          *User: "What do you think of Cuba"
          *Bot: "I heard it is a great vacationing spot"
          *User: How would you travel to these places
          *Bot: I would use a teleporterr and time machine to traverse 4th dimensional barriers to access the current time.

-Several extra responses in the event the user goes elsewhere in the code.
          *User: Why why why why
          *Bot: Dinosaur language barrierr has been met
          *User: What does the fox say
           *Bot: Maybe we should talk about one of my topics

-Added a command and clear command, the command command prints a giant list of everything you can say to get every response, though it is not limited to these commands 
          -The clear command wipes the chat history allowing you to start over.
Added a profile picture selector
But the biggest feature was overhauling and completely removing the Irrelavent topic class and the topic questions interface.
I removed these fully and rewrote the sorting algorithm for how the bot decides what response to give you, this code was considerably less messy, less lines as well
and it was coded in android studio so I was able to make it fully work.
